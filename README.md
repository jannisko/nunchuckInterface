# NunchuckInterface
This project's goal is to read out the analogue signal from a Nintendo Wii Nunchuck controller and print out the data in a human-readable form on a 16x2 character LCD screen.
Because the LCD is to small for all the data we get there is a button to switch between two display modes.

## Nunchuck-Connector:
When the flat part of the nunchuck connector is at the bottom / the U shaped part at the top:
- Top Left: SCL (Arduino: A5)
- Top Right: GND
- Bottom Left: VCC (5V)
- Bottom Right: SDA (Arduino: A4)
